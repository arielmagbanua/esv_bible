# ESV API Bible for Dart

A future based dart package for the [ESV API](https://api.esv.org/) from [Crossway](https://www.crossway.org/)
which can be used to fetch ESV bible passages.

This package requires an API key to fetch bible passages. You can secure an API key by creating a new application on the [ESV API website](https://api.esv.org/).

## Features
* Get [passage text](https://api.esv.org/docs/passage-text/) from ESV Bible API.
* Get [passage html](https://api.esv.org/docs/passage-html/) from ESV Bible API.
* [Search a passage](https://api.esv.org/docs/passage-search/) from ESV Bible API.
* [Download a mp3 audio](https://api.esv.org/docs/passage-audio/) of a bible passage. (in development)

## Getting started

* Secure your API key at the [ESV API website](https://api.esv.org/).
* Import the package.
* To fetch a passage you can use the factory class `GetPassage` to create the passage use case (`PassageHtml`, `PassageText`, `PassageSearch`).
* The use case classes are callable, so calling them will execute an API request and automatically parse and then converts the data to an object.

## Usage

Basic passage text query:
```dart
import 'package:esv_bible/get_passage.dart';

void main () async {
  const apiKey = 'your-api-key';

  final passage = GetPassage.text(apiKey);
  final passageText = await passage('John 3:16');
  print(passageText.passages[0]);
}
```

Output:
```
John 3:16

For God So Loved the World

  [16] â€œFor God so loved the world,(1) that he gave his only Son, that whoever believes in him should not perish but have eternal life.

Footnotes

(1) 3:16 Or *For this is how God loved the world*
 (ESV)
```
